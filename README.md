# Frontend Mentor - Blood Donation Landing Page Challenge

![Design by Clément Marie for the Blood Donation Landing Page Challenge](./design/blood-donation-landing-design.jpg)

Design by: [Clément Marie](http://clement-marie.fr/)

Welcome! Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. 

Your task is to build out the project to the design inside the `/design` folder.

This project poses some nice challenges using CSS gradients. You'll need to place two gradients as a background on the `body` to get the subtle gradients from the design correct.

The challenge does not require any JavaScript and **should not include any front-end frameworks/libraries**.

If you decide to push the project live, tweet **@frontendmentor** once you're finished with your URL in the tweet. I'd love to take a look at what you've built!
